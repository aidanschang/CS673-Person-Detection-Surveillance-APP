### Aidan Chang
I have a BS in hospitality management in 2013 and this is my third final course with MSSD. I have been studying software engineering for about a year and half with an internship experience in data engineering. My specialties are Python, Java, data science (ML), AWS services, some knowledge of Neural Network and CNN, and beginner level of computer vision. I am excited to work with you all and I hope to learn a robust software development skills in this course.

## Matthew Kluska

I have an BS in Applied Math and Statistics. I've worked as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer(MLOps) for 2 years. Now, I lead AI engagements for a consulting company. I have extensive experience in Python, Spark, GIT, Project Management, and AWS(ML Specialty Cert.), my powerpoints could use some work ;) I'm pretty well rounded with NLP, CV, and traditional ML. I hope to get a good breakdown of software engineering methods, frameworks, strategies etc. In the future, I hope to lead multiple software teams. Excited to work with all of you!

## Derric Syme
I have a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA with minors in Information Systems and Data Analytics, and this is my final course in the MSSD program (with a certificate in Software Engineering).  I'm approaching 2 years as a SW engineer mostly in C++ and Python, and currently do a lot of SW testing.  I'm new to Florida, but I've grown fond of the Atlantic.  I'm excited for the team to teach me more about AI/ML processes.

## Brendan Truong
I have a BS in Computer Engineering with 1 years of experience across various interships (Application Developer Intern, Junior Developer, and Software Development and Engineering Intern) and a little over a years experience as a Software Cloud Engineer. I often work with Python, Github, Jenkins, various AWS Services (Certified Cloud Practioner) and Docker. I'm currently working on a Master's in Software Development to reinforce my foundation and knowledge. I've only worked with ML across a few master courses, so I'm looking forward to building this application and learning with everyone!

## Zengrui Luo
I'm BS in Computer Science. I took some courses on python, C, java and javascript. With a little bit sql and github. The most comfort languages for me are python and java.I am looking forward to getting a deep understanding of software engineering. And very happy to work with you on our project
## Patounezambo Ouedraogo
I'm coming from a humanities background. Earned a BA in Theology, a Master of Science in Teaching and currently doing Master of Science in Software Development. I started coding on and off beginning in 2016 with Ruby. Currently I can code in Python, javascript, Java and PHP. Hoping to have industry experience once i'm done with the MSSD program.
